# Applied-ML-Final-Project

This project is aimed at the problem of genre classification of books using their summaries. The methodology uses both supervised and unsupervised techniques, and is based on the CMU Book Summary Database.

The data can be found at: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html

For the use of GloVe embeddings, you would also need to download the pre-trained embeddings from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ and load the 50 D one.
